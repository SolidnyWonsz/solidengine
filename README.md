# Solid Engine

## What is this?

Solid Engine is supposed to be a 3D game engine with limited capatibilites to mimick PS2-era style. It uses OpenGL 3.3 rendering API at it's core. It's possible that I'll extend support for more rendering API like Vulkan, once I'll get a grasp of graphics programming.

Solid Engine aims to support old, low-end PCs, but also possibly the actual hardware of which the aesthetics the engine mimicks - the PS2 itself - using some widely available open source PS2 SDK.

## What is the purpose of this?

I decided to start this project to create a game I had in my mind. Of course I could use an existing engine, but both Unreal Engine and Unity seem a bit overkill to me for what I want to create. Also, I want to program the logic in C++ and sure, I can do that in Unreal Engine, but I hate its workflow. Unity uses C# on the otherhand. I could deal with it, but I hate the GUI system. I want to unite the best of Unreal Engine and Unity - and what's the best is subjective. I add whatever I think is the best.

## Features to add

- Support more platforms (such as PS2, Linux, MacOS)
- Support more renderers
- Actually finish the project
